Updated: 11:50 p. m. The New York Times is driving to Friday’s inauguration with supporters of   Donald J. Trump. On Wednesday, we traveled with a woman from Massachusetts, the bluest state east of the Mississippi. On Thursday, we joined a man from West Virginia, the reddest state in the East. Dianna Ploss, 53, is a volunteer organizer for Mr. Trump, a turn of fate that surprised even her  —   a longtime Democrat who until recently was uninterested in politics. I am a national correspondent for The Times, originally from Granville, Mass. and I rode with a photographer in the back seat of a Dodge pickup driven by Dianna’s friend Scott Hayes, a landscaper. There was a cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump, too. Along the way, we talked about life, Mr. Trump and the future of America. We stopped at a McDonald’s, Cracker Barrel, Applebee’s and multiple rest areas. We listened to Abba, the Supremes, Fleetwood Mac, Cheryl Lynn and Obama. I got carsick. And   hours later, we made it to Washington. SABRINA TAVERNISE _____ GLOUCESTER, Mass. 10:27 a. m.: I just wrapped up a Facebook Live video introduction to Dianna and Scott, and we’re about to leave for the drive. For her part, Dianna spent the past year working tirelessly for Mr. Trump’s campaign, spending her own money and countless hours to get him elected. She was even a delegate at the Republican convention. She also lived for years in Cambridge, where Hillary Clinton won 88 percent of the vote. (Mr. Trump got 6 percent.) She has a rare ability to move back and forth between the two worlds. She has a lot to say about both. She had never really been that interested in politics. She grew up in Boston in the 1970s. Her dad worked as a school bus driver. Her mom raised four children and tended bar. “We were all Democrats back then,” she says. “Forty years later, we are all Republicans. ” Miles driven: 0.
