BRUSSELS  —   Antonio Tajani was elected president of the European Parliament on Tuesday, and he won’t have much time to settle in.

The Parliament needed a “president, not a prime minister,” Mr. Tajani said on Tuesday before the voting. “When I stand in front of the Council, it won’t be my ideas I’ll b
