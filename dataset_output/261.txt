It’s the first year that United Airlines will be offering “basic economy” fares  —   the lowest prices on a particular flight, but with notable restrictions such as: You don’t receive a seat assignment until   (and sitting next to your traveling companions is not guaranteed) you’re the last to board and you’re not allowed to bring on a     bag (which means no use of the overhead bins). On the list of things travelers care about, overhead storage is second only to legroom, according to interviews conducted in December by Morning Consult, a media and technology company. Even so, 45 percent of fliers said they would buy a “basic economy” fare. And those travelers aren’t necessarily strapped for cash: Some 39 percent of fliers earning $100, 000 or more told Morning Consult that they were likely to purchase a basic economy ticket.

But there are ways around those rules. In fact, there are three ways to bring on   luggage and use the overhead bins even if you purchase a “basic economy” fare: 1. If you’re a Premier member of the airline’s MileagePlus loyalty program. 2. If you’re the primary card member of a qualifying MileagePlus credit card. 3. If you’re a Star Alliance Gold member (a frequent flier in the Star Alliance network of nearly 30 airlines). Any of the above will also prevent you from having to board last as well.
