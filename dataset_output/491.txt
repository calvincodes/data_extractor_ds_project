WASHINGTON  —   A spate of violence erupted on Friday in the nation’s capital, as protesters damaged storefronts, threw rocks and bricks at police officers and lit a limousine on fire. Phalanxes of police officers used pepper spray, flash grenades and other nonlethal   tools to disperse the protesters. By the end of the day, six police officers had sustained minor injuries and more than 200 people had been arrested. Many of the protesters were dressed in black, wore face masks and carried flags associated with   groups. They congregated on a series of streets just blocks from the parade where Donald J. Trump passed as he made his way to the White House for the first time as president, their activities creating a distraction as television networks played live footage of the clashes. The violence was focused not only on the police. Richard B. Spencer, a leader of the     a   fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and   positions, was punched in the face by a protester as Mr. Spencer gave an interview on the street, according to a video posted on Twitter. “We’re not peaceful,” said one of the masked protesters who, like many others who clashed with the police, ran away after being approached by reporters. While the clashes occurred, thousands of peaceful protesters marched across the country as they voiced   slogans. In New York, seven people were arrested when they blocked the sidewalk outside Trump Tower. Protesters in San Francisco formed a blockade across train tracks, leading to eight arrests, and chained themselves to the downtown offices of Uber and Wells Fargo. In the central business district of Portland, Ore. banks, clothing retailers and a jewelry store boarded up windows and covered walls to limit vandalism. Chants in English and Spanish broke out in front of the Capitol in Phoenix. “This is one of the darkest days in the history of our country,” said Adelle Wallace, 75, during a   march in Los Angeles.
