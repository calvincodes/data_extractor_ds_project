Whether or not you eat what McDonald’s serves, let’s at least agree the   giant has a knack for putting together unexpected ingredients in a way that no one had seen before. The same could be said about “The Founder,” the biographical film about Ray A. Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) the onetime   salesman who helped transform McDonald’s from a roadside stand in San Bernardino, Calif. to an empire of golden arches. The movie (in wide release Jan. 20) also stars Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as Richard and Maurice McDonald, the brothers (known as Dick and Mac) who created the namesake restaurants and invented the   system, then entered into an uneasy partnership with Kroc, who took over the company. If Kroc is the    engine of “The Founder,” then the McDonald brothers are its heart  —   the loyal siblings whose ingenuity and traditional values are eventually overwhelmed by their new partner’s relentless hustle. The characters also represent a rare pairing for Mr. Offerman (a star of “Parks and Recreation”) and Mr. Lynch (whose films include “Fargo,” “Zodiac” and “Jackie”) two steadily working, sturdily built actors known for quirky, distinctive roles  —   outdoorsmen, lawyers, presidents, mass murderers  —   that stick in your memory, yet who had never acted together before. Mr. Offerman and Mr. Lynch spoke recently by phone about family relationships, onscreen and off, and shared their innermost thoughts about the McDonald’s menu.
