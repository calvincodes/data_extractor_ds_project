The question from the analyst on Thursday was delicate enough. In agreeing to buy the Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings, how would Stanley Black  Decker protect itself from legal issues that could arise at the seller down the line? But the response from Stanley Black  Decker’s chief executive, James M. Loree, acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored: that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday. “We expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears,” Mr. Loree said, adding that he believed such a move was not imminent.

As of Oct. 29, Sears had $258 million in cash and equivalents on hand, compared with $3. 1 billion in   debt, the company said. Its marke
