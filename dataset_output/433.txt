In the latest twist in a legal issue that has galvanized musicians, Paul McCartney filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday against the music publisher   over ownership of some of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Mr. McCartney’s suit is over what is known as copyright termination: the right of authors  —   or any creators  —   to reclaim ownership of their works from publishers after a specific length of time has passed.

The suit asks for a declarative judgment that Mr. McCartney would not be violating any contra
