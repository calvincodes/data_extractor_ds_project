The winner of the feature race on Monday at Aqueduct, it was noted, ran    starting in front and ending that way as the race’s second wagering choice. And yet, despite the bettors’ confidence, the outcome was extraordinarily unusual, and all but unnoticed. The winning owners are brothers who were born in Jamaica: Gaston and Anthony Grant. Gaston Grant served as the horse’s trainer  —   a labor of love that he juggles with his   job as a driver for UPS. The rider, Kendrick Carmouche, was a jockey from Louisiana. All are black.

He was introduced to the track by his father, but his involvement in the sport was confined to gambling until about 20 years ago, when he picked up work as a groom and a   a person who cools down a horse
