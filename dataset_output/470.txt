WASHINGTON  —   Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called “this American carnage. ” In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power, Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by “the ravages” of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his   approach to turn around. “I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down,” Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of   admirers and onlookers in a forceful   Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol. “America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. ” Mr. Trump’s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, he has taken on leaders of both parties and, with no prior political career of his own, made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system. “We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he said. “The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. ” Mr. Trump’s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address  —   a country where mothers and children are “trapped in poverty in our inner cities,” where “  factories” are “scattered like tombstones across the landscape” and where drugs and crime “have stolen too many lives. ” “This American carnage,” he declared, “stops right here and stops right now. ” He
