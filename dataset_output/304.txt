Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, for today’s introduction.

And parts of the state remain dry. But after six years of mandatory conservation orders, there seems reason for celebration. “This series of storms has done
