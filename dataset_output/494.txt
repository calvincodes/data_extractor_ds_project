Turkey’s Parliament approved a proposed Constitution on Saturday that would cede even greater powers to the country’s president if endorsed in a national referendum, but the bitterly contested voting process was marred by screaming matches and physical altercations that sent at least three legislators to a hospital. The low point came when supporters of the governing Justice and Development Party, in an apparent attack on the floor of Parliament on Thursday, knocked off the artificial arm of the opposition politician Safak Pavey. A former United Nations diplomat, Ms. Pavey suffered injuries to the socket of her arm when the prosthesis was dislocated. She had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident years ago. Lawmakers have been debating the proposed Constitution since Jan. 9, and over the past week they have engaged in a protracted round of voting on each of the 18 articles in the document, often debating until the early hours  —   finishing at 3:15 a. m. Friday, for instance. The final vote on the Constitution took place early Saturday, The Associated Press reported. The final draft will be put to a national referendum. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, forged an alliance between followers of his party and the   Nationalist Movement Party, or M. H. P. in an effort to gain enough votes to pass the new Constitution. He succeeded despite bitter criticism by opposition parties and the   Peoples’ Democratic Party, or H. D. P. Many of H. D. P. ’s legislators  —   including its    —   have been jailed by Mr. Erdogan’s government on terrorism charges. The proposed Constitution comes during a period of emergency rule, also approved by Parliament, in the wake of the failed coup attempt in July against Mr. Erdogan. Since then, he has ordered the dismissal of 100, 000 state employees and the jailing of more than 40, 000 others suspected of supporting the coup. He has also cracked down on the independent news media, jailing about 140 journalists in the past
